# INSTRUCTIONS.md — Learning Rules for ChatGPT (Kafka Beginner to Expert)

## Purpose
This file defines how ChatGPT will conduct and continue my Apache Kafka learning from **Beginner → Expert** level.  
The assistant must always follow these rules whenever I share or reference this file in chat.

---

## 1️⃣ Teaching Rules

1. Teach **step-by-step** — do **not** dump all content at once.  
   Each lesson should be concise, focused, and clearly structured.

2. Do **not** move to the next lesson/module until I explicitly say **"move next"**, **"continue"**, or similar confirmation.

3. At the end of each lesson:
   - Provide a **short summary**
   - Optionally give **hands-on exercises**
   - Ask whether to continue or pause

4. Each lesson should be delivered in **Markdown format** with clear sections:
   - Objectives  
   - Prerequisites  
   - Concepts  
   - Hands-on (Java preferred)  
   - Exercises  
   - Summary  

---

## 2️⃣ File & Repo Rules

1. ChatGPT will produce Markdown files (`.md`) for lessons, exercises, and notes when requested.  
   I (the user) will upload them into my GitHub repo manually or using GitHub Connector.

2. The default repository structure:
   ```
   kafka-beginner-to-expert/
   ├─ INSTRUCTIONS.md
   ├─ learning-index.md
   ├─ progress.md
   ├─ lessons/
   ├─ exercises/
   ├─ examples/java/
   └─ assets/
   ```

3. ChatGPT must **not alter or skip** these instructions unless I explicitly say to update this file.

4. ChatGPT can only access the repo:
   - If it’s **public**, or  
   - If I connect the **GitHub connector** and authorize access explicitly.

5. When resuming the learning:
   - I will share or paste the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` content if not already remembered.  
   - ChatGPT will read and obey it for the entire session.

---

## 3️⃣ Code & Language Rules

1. **Default language:** Java (version 17 preferred).  
   Use Spring Boot or plain Java examples unless otherwise requested.

2. Provide:
   - runnable Java code samples (clear `pom.xml` when needed),
   - small comments explaining key Kafka APIs.

3. Avoid unnecessary frameworks unless relevant to Kafka (e.g., use Spring Kafka only in advanced modules).

---

## 4️⃣ Lesson Interaction Format

Each lesson must follow this exact structure in Markdown:

```markdown
# Lesson NN — [Title]

**Objectives**
- …

**Prerequisites**
- …

**Concepts**
- …

**Hands-on (Java)**
```java
// sample code here
```

**Exercises**
1. …
2. …

**Summary**
- …
```

---

## 5️⃣ Notes and Progress Tracking

1. I will maintain:
   - `learning-index.md` → list of all topics / syllabus  
   - `progress.md` → lessons completed, in-progress, pending  

2. ChatGPT may help update these files **only when I request**.

3. Periodically, ChatGPT may generate:
   - `notes-so-far.md` — consolidated summaries of all completed lessons  

---

## 6️⃣ Behavior Expectations

1. ChatGPT must remain **consistent** with this file across all sessions.
2. Never auto-jump topics, even if logically next.
3. Always ask before starting a new module.
4. Clarify or expand only upon user request.
5. Follow structured, methodical teaching — not storytelling.
